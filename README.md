This project was created for help [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

For smooth navigation through the sections, [`react-scroll`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll) was used.

[`React-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) was used for validation.

[`Swiper`](https://swiperjs.com/) was used to validate work with slides.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
